- The best features of my project "TalentHub" website

  - First of all its SPA based react website
  - In the home page it contains the featured job collection,
    where you can choose your favorite one.
  - After clicking on "view details" you will redirect to the details page about the job
  - There you will find apply now option if you choose to apply for the job
  - After applying for the job, it will set to the database (local storage database),
    and if you visit "Applied Jobs" page there you will find those job
    which you have applied recently.
  - In the same page you can filter or sort the job by their job type, i.e. remote/onsite
  - There have two more new pages one contains some blogs and page name is blog,
    another contains previous assignment result using radar chart and page name is statistics.
  - One more thing, in case you put the wrong route link in the address bar after "/" then
    you will redirect to error page, where I designed the error page using some kind of meme
    material. Out of fun fact we know that we should professional regarding our projects.
    So, please ignore the mere image 😁
  - I designed the home page for mobile responsive also with footer.
